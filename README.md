## Connie Reinholdsson

Whilst working as a Marketing Graduate at Samsung Electronics Ltd, I developed a passion for digital and became increasingly interested in how our world is changing through digitalisation, social media and information sharing. With that came a desire to increase my technical knowledge and I started learning how to code. Little did I know that I would become so addicted to solving problems, researching solutions and earning badges on Code Academy, that I would decide to turn it into a career.

I am an open-minded, motivated and creative self-starter who loves problem-solving, new challenges and isn’t afraid to come up with radical solutions. Above all, I’m an optimistic researcher who believes there’s is an answer to almost everything, and whether tackling a kata, making a new recipe or trying a new yoga tutorial - I don’t commit to anything before I’ve received advice from my two best friends - Google and YouTube.

I’m looking for a Full Stack Junior Developer role in an innovative environment where there is scope for me to learn and grow as a Developer, with long-term career prospects. I would love to work in a team where I can add value not only as a developer, but to the business as a whole and pick up new skills and experiences.

## Skills

#### Commercial Context

Having experience from both the operational and customer side of businesses, I always ask myself why I’m doing something. Approaching coding tasks from a commercial context allows me to take a step back, understand the required programme functionalities and scope and suggest the best solution from a business perspective. For example, when creating the app ‘Student Directory’, I wrote down its purpose, what problem it would solve, put it into business context and improved the user feedback functionalities and flexibility to make it more user-friendly.

#### Learning Agility

During my Marketing Graduate Scheme at Samsung Electronics I moved roles every 4-5 months and I had to quickly pick up the relevant knowledge and information to meet my performance objectives and make a name for myself in each division. I set up my own inductions, researched the industry, asked for relevant documents and asked questions. As a result of learning fast, I was asked to organise and deliver a UK wide 4-week experiential activity after only three months of working in the company, which turned out to be an online success.

#### Problem-solver

Being a problem-solver at heart, I chose to specialise in Mathematics, Analytics, Business Modelling & Optimisation for my degree and received 1st class results across all Mathematics modules. But more importantly, I apply my problem-solving skills in real work and life situations. For example, during my internship at Rolls-Royce plc I spotted a number of problems which slowed down our work processes, and came up with solutions. This included the production of an e-learning course and the introduction of an IT Back-up System Instruction Booklet.
