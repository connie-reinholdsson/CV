### <a name="hello">About</a>

I am a highly motivated, creative and curious self-starter who is passionate about tech and believe the best code is written with tea breaks, a healthy body and an open mind. I am looking for a Full Stack Developer role in an innovative, sociable and dynamic environment where I can grow as a person and professional.

After graduating with an International Business BSc degree from Loughborough University, I spent 18 months working as a Marketing Graduate for Samsung Electronics (UK) Ltd. Whilst working in digital marketing, I developed a passion for technology and started coding in my free time, until I became so addicted to solving-problems and building websites that I decided to pursue it as a career. I am now fulfilling my dreams at Maker's Academy, where I spend every day diving below the interface and learning about the world of software development.

#### Communication
When starting at Maker's Academy, I decided to write a blog about my experience. At first I found it very difficult, having never before  published an article, but to my surprise writing about programming was different. It enabled me to learn faster by reflecting on each week and pinpointing ways in which I could improve. Seven weeks into Makers I attend an Android Development workshop run by Codebar. I wrote a blogpost about what the workshop had taught me and Codelog published it. It also got lots of attention on Twitter and was endorsed by the organiser, who themselves is an Android developer.

#### Learning Agility

During my Marketing Graduate Scheme at Samsung Electronics I moved roles every 4-5 months and I quickly picked up the relevant knowledge and information to meet my performance objectives, making a name for myself in each division. I set up my own introductions, researched the industry and sought out relevant documents in order to increase my knowledge. As a result of my quick learning, in only my third month at the company, I was asked to organise and deliver a UK wide 4-week marketing event. This was presented back to my global headquarters and turned out to be a huge online success.

#### Problem-solver

Being a problem-solver at heart, I chose to specialise in Mathematics, Analytics, Business Modelling & Optimisation for my degree. As well as receiving first class honours, I regularly apply my problem-solving skills in real life and work situations. For example, during my internship at Rolls-Royce plc I identified a number of problems which were hindering our work processes. I came up with a number of measures to eradicate these issues, which included the production of an e-learning course and the introduction of an IT Back-up System Instruction Booklet.
