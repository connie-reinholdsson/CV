### <a name="hello">About</a>

I am a highly motivated, creative and curious self-starter who is passionate about tech and believe the best code is written with regular tea breaks, a healthy body and an open mind. I am looking for a Full Stack Developer role in an innovative, sociable and dynamic environment where I can grow as a person and professional.

After graduating with an International Business BSc degree from Loughborough University, I spent 18 months working as a Marketing Graduate for Samsung Electronics (UK) Ltd. Whilst working in digital marketing, I developed a passion for technology and started coding in my free time, until I became so addicted to solving-problems and building websites that I decided to pursue it as a career. I am now fulfilling my dreams at Maker's Academy, where I spend every day diving below the interface and learning about the world of software development.

#### Communication
When starting at Maker's Academy, I decided to write a blog about my experience. At first I found it very difficult, having never published an article in my life. But to my surprise, writing about programming was different and it helped my learning through reflecting on every week and ways in which I could improve. Seven weeks on, after attending an Android Development workshop run by Codebar, I wrote a blogpost about it and Codelog published it and made me a writer. It also got shared on Twitter through influential people in the industry.

#### Learning Agility

During my Marketing Graduate Scheme at Samsung Electronics I moved roles every 4-5 months and I had to quickly pick up the relevant knowledge and information to meet my performance objectives and make a name for myself in each division. I set up my own inductions, researched the industry, asked for relevant documents and asked questions. As a result of learning fast, I was asked to organise and deliver a UK wide 4-week experiential activity after only three months of working in the company, which turned out to be an online success.

#### Problem-solver

Being a problem-solver at heart, I chose to specialise in Mathematics, Analytics, Business Modelling & Optimisation for my degree and received 1st class results across all Mathematics modules. But more importantly, I apply my problem-solving skills in real work and life situations. For example, during my internship at Rolls-Royce plc I spotted a number of problems which slowed down our work processes, and came up with solutions. This included the production of an e-learning course and the introduction of an IT Back-up System Instruction Booklet.
